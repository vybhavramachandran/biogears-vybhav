<h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3>
<p>
    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your
    BioGears&reg; registration information (i.e., name, email, phone number) is contained behind secured
    networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such
    systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your
    personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply
    is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only
    accessed as stated above. For more information about our Security Procedures, please visit the Security
    Procedures section below.
</p>
<h3>Do we use "cookies"?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
    through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize
    your browser and capture and remember certain information. Cookies are also used to help us understand your
    preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
    services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction
    so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
</p>
<p>
    We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.
    These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help
    us conduct and improve our business.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to
    turn off all cookies. You can change these settings through your browser (like Firefox or Internet
    Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn
    the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features
    that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.
</p>

<p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information
    unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does
    not include ARA. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in
    operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to
    keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is
    appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights,
    property, or safety.
</p>
<p>
    However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for
    marketing, advertising, or other uses.
