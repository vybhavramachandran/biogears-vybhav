<h3>Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
    This site and the materials and products on this site are provided "as is" and without warranties
    of any kind, whether express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable
    law, ARA disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied
    warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. ARA does
    not represent or warrant that the functions contained in the site will be uninterrupted or error-free,

    regarding the use of the materials in this site in terms of their correctness, accuracy, adequacy,
    usefulness, timeliness, reliability or otherwise. Some states do not permit limitations or exclusions
    on warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you. When applicable, additional warranty

</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>
    ARA shall not be liable for any special or consequential damages that result from the use of,
    or the inability to use, the materials on this site or the performance of the products, even if
    ARA has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the limitation
    of exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
    exclusion may not apply to you.
</p>
<h3>Term; Termination</h3>
<p>
    These terms and conditions are applicable to you upon your accessing the site and/or completing
    the registration. These terms and conditions, or any part of them, may be
    terminated by ARA without notice at any time, for any reason. The provisions relating to Copyrights,
    Trademark, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification and Miscellaneous, shall survive any termination.
</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>
    ARA may deliver notice to you by means of e-mail, a general notice on the site, or by other
    reliable method to the address you have provided to ARA.
</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
    Your use of this site shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of New Mexico,
    U.S.A., without regard to choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on
    contracts for the international sale of goods. You agree that jurisdiction over and venue in any
    legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this site (including but
    not limited to the purchase of ARA products) shall be in the state or federal courts located in
    Albuquerque, N.M. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the site (including
    but not limited to the purchase of ARA products) must be commenced within one (1) year after the
    claim or cause of action arises. ARA's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of
    any provision of these terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision
    or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to
    modify any of these terms and conditions. ARA may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement
    to any party at any time without notice to you.
</p>
<h3>Use of Site</h3>
<p>
    Harassment in any manner or form on the site, including via e-mail, chat, or by use of obscene or
    abusive language, is strictly forbidden. Impersonation of others, including an ARA or other licensed
    employee, host, or representative, as well as other members or visitors on the site is prohibited.
    You may not upload to, distribute, or otherwise publish through the site any content which is libelous,
    defamatory, obscene, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or
    otherwise objectionable which may constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of
    any party or which may otherwise give rise to liability or violate any law. You may not upload
    commercial content on the site or use the site to solicit others to join or become members of any
    other commercial online service or other organization.
</p>
<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>
    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ARA, its officers, directors, employees, agents,
    licensors and suppliers (collectively the "Service Providers") from and against all losses, expenses,
    damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these terms
    and conditions or any activity related to your account (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by
    you or any other person accessing the site using your Internet account.
</p>
<h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
<p>
    In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, ARA may link to sites operated by third
    parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with ARA, ARA has no control over these
    linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of ARA.
    These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk.
    Nonetheless, ARA seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and
    therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including
    if a specific link does not work).
</p>
<h3>Right of Refusal</h3>
<p>
    ARA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any order without explanation.
    Should ARA reject your order, your order will not be processed and you will not be charged or billed.
