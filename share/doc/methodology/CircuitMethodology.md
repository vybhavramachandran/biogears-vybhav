# Overview

## Abstract

The BioGear&reg; Circuit Solver was created to extract the lumped parameter
physics calculations from within the individual systems and centralize the generic calculations.  Closed loop
circuits can be defined easily within the Common Data Model (CDM).  They
are fully dynamic, and can be manipulated and modified at each time
step.  The solver can be used to analyze electrical, fluid, and thermal
circuits using native units.  The solver outputs were validated using the outputs from an existing known third party circuit solver.  All results matched the validation data, confirming this is a sound approach for
the %BioGears Engine.

## Introduction

%BioGears systems use lumped parameter circuits to mimic the physiology
of the human body.  These circuits use fluid or thermal elements that
are analogous to electrical circuit elements.  The
circuits have several types of feedback mechanisms that can be set and
changed at every time step.  Figure&nbsp;1 presents a generic example of very low fidelity lumped
parameter physiology circuits.  Circuits can be thought of as pipe networks for fluid analysis.

*Note: For simplicity, this document uses electrical components and terminology when discussing the solver functionality.  See Table&nbsp;1 for analogies and details about the mapping of electrical components.*

The %BioGears CDM includes many of the same generic definitions traditionally used to define and analyze circuits.  Paths are ideal conductor branches that may contain elements (i.e., resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, etc.).  Nodes are junctions at the intersection of paths.  Figure&nbsp;2 shows these base circuit element definitions.  Paths are each assigned one source and one target node.  We use the convention of positive current from source to target when performing calculations.

Nodes are placed at the intersections of paths.  In fluid systems, paths can be thought of as frictionless pipes and nodes as pipe junctions.</i>

# System Design

## Background and Scope

### Legacy Solution

The physiology engine from which %BioGears was spawned (released by
Advanced Simulation Corporation as Body Simulation for Anesthesia&trade;)
solved each lump parameter circuit using non-closed loop calculations
contained within each system.  The systems were extensively
interconnected and the circuit calculations were unable to be decoupled.
This made it extremely difficult to find sources of errors and inconsistencies in output results.

The circuit math was performed often using different approaches, with
mixed results.  It became apparent that neither energy nor mass was
being truly conserved.  This was true within the individual systems, as
well as within the entire body.  One-way fluid valves in
the %Cardiovascular System (similar to electrical diodes) would
inadvertently allow backflow for a single time step when flows changed
direction.  Little validation was done to provide a sound
fundamental base on which to build physiological systems.

### Requirements

Given the overall goals of %BioGears, we set out to create a generic
circuit solver on which to expand.  The solver is required to efficiently
solve transient linear and non-linear circuits.  Some other high-level
requirements include:

-   Generic - All systems should be able to use the same basic circuit
    physics engine.  This allows rapid development, and makes engine
    outputs much easier to validate and verify.

-   Computational Speed - %BioGears is required to maintain a transient
    full-body solution faster than real time on typical personal
    computers.

-   Modular - Using the same basis for design and construction will aid
    in keeping the system decoupled.

-   Extensible - We must take future growth into consideration and allow
    users and developers the proper tools and building blocks on which
    to add new functionality.

-   Dynamic - Feedback mechanisms are required for each system.  It is
    beneficial to be able to dynamically change, add, or remove
    circuits, sub-circuits, elements, and connections at run time.

-   Conservation - We must uphold sound scientific principles and conserve energy, mass, and momentum.

-   Common Data Model - The entire solution must reside within and
    effectively use the @ref CDM.

-   Circuits types - %BioGears will include fluid and thermal
    circuits.  It is beneficial to use the same solver for both types of
    systems.

-   Elements - The solver must be able to handle all base circuit
    elements (i.e., resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.), with room
    for expansion.

-   Open source - As a whole, any third-party software must adhere to the same
    license requirements as %BioGears.

### Solutions Investigated

We considered several circuit solver options, including investigating existing
software to determine if any would meet our needs.  The best external
code we found for integration into our C++ open source code was a
variation on SPICE (Berkeley University&rsquo;s Spice3f5), called Ngspice
(http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/).  Ngspice is an open source, general
purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear and linear analyses.  It
is developed with a C++ wrapper that maintains the original parametric
netlist format (netlists can contain parameters and expressions)
as inputs.

During implementation, we found Ngspice to be a good fit for our
needs to solve closed-loop circuits, yet several negatives forced us to
deviate from that path.  We discovered a small number of bugs, some with
possible workarounds.  It was found to be very slow for our approach of
solving a new (i.e., dynamic) circuit each time step.  It was cumbersome
to parse using the netlist input and output style.  The most significant
downside against implementing Ngspice into %BioGears was the
unavoidable build-up of memory that caused our software to crash.

Due to the aforementioned complications, we ultimately determined that
creating our own generalized circuit analysis code was ideal and less
labor-intensive than implementing existing software.  This has the added
benefit of allowing us to control every aspect of the analysis.

@anchor circuit-data
## Data Flow

Our generic Circuit Solver intentionally mirrors the same data flow
found in each of the systems.  Each time step consists of a Preprocess
call to set up the circuits for analysis, a Process call to do the
analysis, and a Post Process call to advance the time in preparation for the
next time step.

### Preprocess

There is no literal Preprocess call within the circuit solver class (i.e., code).  Each system individually and directly modifies its circuit(s).  This allows our functionality to be entirely dynamic by performing a separate calculation every time step.  See the Data Model Implementation Appendix below for details about %BioGears circuit elements and the data they contain.

### Process

For the circuit-solving software to effectively calculate the nonlinear
circuit states without human intervention, a robust, generic, and
repeatable methodology is required.  The solver performs numerical
integration through linearization (first order approximations) by
assuming a direct current (DC) solution for the given time step.  The Modified Nodal
Analysis (MNA) approach is used to determine the state of every node and path
within the circuit.  The steps for solving a circuit in a given time step
are (also see Figure&nbsp;3):

1.  Perform numerical integration by using linearization (first order
    approximations) through MNA, using the matrix
    algebra equation:

	<center>
    \f[Ax = b\f]
	</center>
	
	<center>
	*Equation 1.*
	</center><br>    

    Where *A* is the matrix of constants, *x* is the vector of unknowns/variables, and *b* is the right side vector of knowns.

    1.  Use Kirkoff&rsquo;s Current Laws (KCL) (sum of the currents is zero at
        each node) to populate the *A* matrix and *b* vector.  Table&nbsp;2 shows the equations used for determining flows, where flows (*F*) are equivalent to currents, and pressures (*P*) are equivalent to voltages.

    2.  Leverage the Eigen templated library (released by Tuxfamily) LU
        decomposition linear solver (FullPivLU) to solve for unknown
        variables (i.e., voltages and currents).  This decomposition
        provides the generic approach to solving systems of linear
        equationsâ€‹, and represents an LU decomposition of any matrix
        with complete pivoting.  The matrix *A* is decomposed as:

		\f[A=P^{-1} LUQ^{-1} \f] 
		<center>
		*Equation 2.*
		</center><br> 

		Where *L* is unit-lower-triangular, *U* is upper-triangular, and *P* and *Q* are
		permutation matrices.  This is a rank-revealing LU decomposition.  The
		eigenvalues (diagonal coefficients) of *U* are sorted in such a way that
		any zeros are at the end.

2.  Calculate remaining unknown currents using the Trapezoidal Rule,
    where applicable.  For nonlinear elements from time *a* to *b*, this is:

	\f[\int _{a}^{b}f(x)dx\approx (b-a)\left[\frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2} \right] \f] 

	<center>
	*Equation 3.*
	</center><br>

3.  Calculate diode currents using assumed open or closed switch states (cannot be solved directly).
    Iterate Steps 1&ndash;3 until a satisfactory solution is attained.

4.  Calculate the change in charge (*Q*) across capacitors based on the capacitance (*C*) and voltage (*V*) change, and increment the
    total charge.  The charge is conserved on the source and target nodes by incrementing/decrementing this amount.  Selecting which node gains charge and which loses is done by the direction of the current in the path.
	
	\f[Q(t)=C*V(t)\f] 

	<center>
	*Equation 4.*
	</center><br>

5.  Invalidate the current on any path the user has specified to ignore.
    Note that this is to prevent unwanted transport to the reference
    node (i.e., ground).

*Figure 3.  Data flow chart showing the steps used at each time step to
determine each circuit state.*
</center><br>

There are several nuances for the handling of certain elements:

-   Paths without elements are calculated as if they are zero voltage
    sources, which allows for direct solving for the current.

-   Switches are modeled as element-less paths when closed and
    essentially infinite resistances (10<sup>100</sup> ohms) when open.

-   Valves (i.e., Diodes) are modeled as closed switches when the path source node voltage is higher than the target node (on) and as open switches when the voltage is greater on the target node (off).

-   Polarized elements are modeled as an open switch when preventing polarity reversal

Because diode and polarized element states cannot be determined
before solving a circuit, we are forced to make a considered guess.
Therefore, at each time step, we begin with an assumed on/off state for
each of these elements in the circuit.  We begin with the previous time step solution
to minimize the number of iterations.  The entire circuit is solved using
this assumed state, and the currents and voltages associated with the
paths are considered.  When a diode/polarized element is found to have an incorrect
current direction or voltage reversed relative to its assumed state, the
state is flipped.  This process is then repeated until the valid solution
is found.  Intelligently choosing which diode states to switch is
important because there are 2^(Number of Diodes/Polarized Elements) possible combinations in each circuit.

### Post Process

Post Process effectively advances time by moving the &ldquo;next&rdquo; time step
parameter values to the &ldquo;current&rdquo; time step parameter values (see @ref SystemMethodology).

## Features and Capabilities

### Approach and Extensibility

The %BioGears systems use two different lumped parameter system types,
each with analogies to electrical circuits.  Most systems models (%Cardiovascular, %Respiratory, etc.) use fluid units (pressures, flows,
and volumes), while others (%Energy, %Environment, etc.) use thermal units
(temperature, heat transfer rate, and heat).  Both model types use the same
underlying physics to define relationships and solve for unknown values.
We included the ability to calculate in native electrical
units (voltage, current, and charge) to help with validation using known
electrical circuit models and outputs.  Table&nbsp;1 lists system analogies and
how they map to circuit elements.

<center><br>
<i>Table 1.  The various types of circuits that can be solved by the
Circuit Solver.  Some have units already defined and included in the CDM,
while the others can be easily added.  Possible inputs, outputs, elements,
and parameters are all defined.  Valves (diodes) and
switches are not shown @cite riggs1976control.</i>
</center>
@image html CircuitSystemAnalogies.png
<br>

While we designed the generic Circuit Solver to analyze our fluid,
thermal, and electrical models, we can easily extend it to include any
of the model types in Table&nbsp;1.  Further details specific to the
implementation of our model with the hydraulic analogy are shown in Table&nbsp;2.  
A more intuitive pipe analogy is described through images.  The
%BioGears defined fluid model elements are outlined in the first column.
The flow equations are important for our analysis technique outlined earlier.

circuits that are used extensively inside %BioGears.  The Elements are

</center>
@image html CircuitHydraulicAnalogyTable.png
<br>

The Circuit Solver is equipped to use all of the element types given in the second column of Table&nbsp;2.  All three passive element types (resistor, capacitor, and inductor) have a polarized element modeling option.  When active, polarized elements will short the circuit when the target node voltage becomes greater than that of the source node.  This allows the user to model electrolytic capacitors and further ensures fluid will not be added to hydraulic systems if compliances switch polarity.

### Data Model Implementation

Our mathematical approach to solving circuits is relatively straightforward, but our CDM implementation and integration with physiological
models is novel.  We implemented the Circuit Solver to use generic terms
that are not specific to any one model type (see Table&nbsp;1).  Conversions to base units for each model are done in the
background using the CDM unit conversion functionality.  These base units
are selected to prevent unnecessary conversion that would use critical
computation resources, while still maintaining a direct mathematical
relationship on both sides of the equation when performing the
calculations.

The CDM allows us to implement the circuit math in a completely modular
fashion.  Every system uses the same physics, with the same CDM-defined
elements.  The burden on system developers is merely in setting up and
manipulating the circuit correctly.  A benefit to using a CDM is a significantly reduced
development time.

The only significant requirement for circuit design is that it must be closed-loop.  Beyond that, the solver can handle any combination of valid nodes,
paths, and elements.  Only one (or zero) element is allowed on each path
and the convention of positive current going from source node to target
node is used.

This sound foundation for defining and calculating circuit parameters, allows
the engine to transport substances in a similarly generic fashion (see @ref DrugsMethodology).

@anchor circuit-assumptions
## Assumptions

### Circuits

There are several assumptions made for the circuit math in general:

-   All circuits must be closed-loop

-   All elements are idealized

-   All circuits must have a reference node defined with a known voltage - unlike other circuit solvers, it does not necessarily have to have a potential value of zero

-   Nonlinear sources need initial values.  Therefore, paths with
    capacitors that do not have an initial voltage on the source or
    target nodes will assign it the reference node voltage value, and
    paths with inductors that do not have an initial current will be
    assigned a value of zero.

### Fluids

There are other assumptions specific to the %BioGears fluid systems:

-   Flows are incompressible

-   Fluids are inviscid

## Limitations

There are frequency response limitations that are directly tied to the
time step set externally to the solver itself.  %BioGears uses a time step
of 1/50 s (~ 2 ms).  Because the solver calculates nonlinear
behavior through linearization using the trapezoid rule, extremely high
frequency signal components will be lost.  However, this far exceeds the Nyquist frequency for all current %BioGears system models.

While it is not necessarily a limitation, users of the Circuit Solver
must be careful to assign current and voltage source elements to set currents and voltages respectively.
Attempting to directly set node voltages or path currents would result
in an over-constrained solution.  In these instances, the solver will
overwrite those values.

# Results and Conclusions

## Validation

Beyond several numerical (hand) calculations used during implementation, we
performed validation on the generalized circuit math by duplicating
circuits in LTspice (version 4.21s, created by Linear Technology,
Milpitas, CA).  LTspice is based on the well-documented and validated
SPICE simulator.  We created circuits using all %BioGears elements
individually and in combination.  We used several different types of
dynamically-changing drivers to ensure proper transient functionality.
The resulting voltage and current values were interpolated and validated
to match for all 114 circuits.  Table&nbsp;3 shows a summary of the validation
circuits investigated.

The most interesting and complex circuits use a combination of all
elements.  Two of these comprehensive circuits are shown below because of
their complexity.  The first uses sine wave sources and the second uses
pulse sources.  There is a strong correlation between the given LTspice
outputs and the calculated %BioGears outputs.  Note that the sign
convention of the current across voltage sources is reversed for LTspice,
because it does not maintain the source-to-target positive current
standard as is done with %BioGears.

%BioGears has been shown to successfully conserve mass, energy, and momentum within all defined closed-loop systems. The successful conservation of mass provided by the solver is shown in Figure 10. The volume (quantity/charge) within cardiovascular circuit nodes through approximately 2.5 full heart beat cycles.  The total volume of all compartments remains at a constant value of 5L throughout the entire process.

*Figure 10.  The blood volume within each compartment continuously varies in the cardiovascular circuit.   The sum of these volumes does not change at any time step, and system mass is successfully conserved.*

All basic Circuit Solver functionality is further validated and verified with specific unit tests that target individual methods.  The following functionality has been successfully validated by individual tests:
-   Incorrect usage errors
-   Combined circuits
-   Dynamically-changing elements
-   Dynamically-changing circuits
-   Added and removed elements
-   Fluid, thermal, and electrical model types
-   Non-zero reference node voltage
-   Polarized elements
-   Dynamically modifying capacitor charge

## Conclusion

The %BioGears generalized circuit analysis techniques have successfully
accomplished all of the goals for that area of the code.  The solver
implements the CDM effectively and generically in a way that allows for
infinitely complex lumped parameter models that can also be combined.  We
made it simple to modify existing functionality and add new models.
This has saved, and will continue to save, significant amounts of
development time.  The generic and modular design also allows for much
easier bug finding and fixing, system parameter tuning, and system
validation.  The burden for the modeler is on creating a good model and not
worrying about implementing sound physics math.

The Circuit Solver has also been designed such that it can be extracted
from %BioGears and used for any software that needs to perform transient
circuit analysis.
