## Licensing & Trademarks
## Source Code
All BioGears&trade; software is open source and free software. This means that it is not only available for download free of charge, but you have access to the source code and may modify and redistribute our software subject to certain restrictions.
For more details, please read about our source code license and software licensing policy.
## Trademarks
Although our code is free, it is very important that we strictly enforce our trademark rights, in order to be able to protect our users against people who use the marks to commit fraud. This means that, while you have considerable freedom to redistribute and modify our software, there are tight restrictions on your ability to use the BioGears&trade; names and logos in ways which fall in the domain of trademark law, even when built into binaries that we provide.
For more detail on our trademark licensing, see our BioGears&trade; Trademark Guidelines. If you still have questions after reading the policy, please contact admin@biogears-engine.com.
## Website Content
The text of BioGears&trade; websites is generally licensed under all rights reserved. Tables and Validation can be used under Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) in reference to offical BioGears&trade; releases.  Use of all images is under the sole discretion of Applied Research Associates and the BioGears&trade; project.

## Website Code
You may use the HTML and CSS files on www.BioGearsEngine.com and wwwBioGears.dev or other BioGears&trade; websites for your web site - as long as you don't use the visual design or style (the colors, gradients, fonts, etc.). In other words, you can use the HTML and/or CSS code, but your page should not look like you took BioGears&trade;'s page and dropped in your logo. This does not grant you any right to use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, or trade dress of Applied Research Associates or its products.
## Executable Software
Executable software binaries released by the BioGears&trade; Project, such as libBioGears and BioGearsUI, are made available under the terms of the APACHE2.0 License. On some proprietary, non-free platforms, necessary binary components subject to other licenses may be included in the installer, as explained in this policy.
Informative, Not Authoritative
This page is designed to inform, not to be the final, authoritative reference. If you're looking to reuse or redistribute something BioGears&trade; has created, always check the licensing in the thing itself (for example, in the footer of a web page, or in the "About" box of software) after you've looked at this document.
In case of a conflict between this document and other documents (for example, if this document and the header file of a particular source code file conflict) the other document should take precedence. If you do discover such a conflict, please notify licensing@biogearsengine.com so we can fix it.
Questions?
If, after reading all the above carefully, you have a further question about the licensing terms of anything created by the BioGears&trade; project, please send the question to  licensing@biogearsengine.com.
